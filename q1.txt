Http 1.1

HTTP/1.1, short for Hypertext Transfer Protocol 1.1, is a protocol used for transferring data over the World Wide Web.
It's the standard protocol used by web browsers and servers to communicate with each other. 
HTTP/1.1 was introduced as an upgrade to HTTP/1.0, aiming to improve performance and efficiency.

Key features of HTTP/1.1 include:

1) Persistent Connections.
2) Request Pipelining
3) Caching.
4) Chunked Transfer Encoding.
5) Compression.


HTTP/1.1 has been the predominant version of the HTTP protocol for many years and has served as the foundation for the modern web. 
However, it does have limitations, particularly in handling concurrent requests and prioritizing resources. 
These limitations led to the development of HTTP/2, which introduced significant enhancements to address these issues and further optimize web performance.

Http 2

HTTP/2 introduces significant improvements in performance, efficiency, and features. 
By leveraging multiplexing, header compression, binary protocol, server push, and stream prioritization, 
HTTP/2 offers a faster and more responsive web experience, especially for complex and resource-intensive web applications.

Multiplexing:

HTTP/1.1: In HTTP/1.1, each request/response cycle typically requires a separate connection. 
This can lead to head-of-line blocking issues, where subsequent requests are delayed while waiting for previous ones to complete.
HTTP/2: HTTP/2 introduces multiplexing, allowing multiple requests and responses to be sent and received concurrently over a single TCP connection. This eliminates head-of-line blocking and improves overall performance, especially for modern web applications with many resources.


Header Compression:

HTTP/1.1: Headers are sent in plaintext with each request and response, leading to increased overhead and slower performance, especially over high-latency connections.
HTTP/2: HTTP/2 employs header compression, reducing the size of headers transferred between the client and server. 
This optimization decreases latency and improves network efficiency, particularly on bandwidth-constrained connections.


Binary Protocol:

HTTP/1.1: HTTP/1.1 is a text-based protocol, which is human-readable but can be verbose and less efficient for machines to parse.
HTTP/2: HTTP/2 is a binary protocol, meaning data is encoded in binary format for transmission. 
This reduces overhead and makes parsing more efficient for both clients and servers, resulting in faster processing and improved performance.


Server Push:

HTTP/1.1: In HTTP/1.1, additional resources must be explicitly requested by the client, even if they are likely to be needed. 
This can result in suboptimal performance, especially for complex web applications with many dependencies.
HTTP/2: HTTP/2 introduces server push, allowing the server to proactively send additional resources to the client before they are requested. 
This can reduce the number of round trips and speed up page load times by anticipating the client's needs.


Stream Prioritization:

HTTP/1.1: Requests are processed in the order they are received, with no mechanism for prioritization. 
This can lead to inefficient resource allocation, especially in scenarios with limited network bandwidth.
HTTP/2: HTTP/2 supports stream prioritization, allowing clients to assign priority levels to different resources. 
This enables more efficient resource allocation and can improve user experience, particularly for critical assets like CSS and JavaScript files.
